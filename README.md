# 🧠 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## 📄 Project Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** — a powerful dimensionality reduction technique widely used in data science and machine learning. PCA transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional form while retaining the maximum possible variance.  
The goal of this project is to simplify complex datasets, visualize the reduced features, and enhance model efficiency without significant information loss.

Through this notebook, the workflow includes:
- Data preprocessing and standardization.
- Applying PCA using `scikit-learn`.
- Visualizing variance explained by each principal component.
- Interpreting PCA results and understanding feature correlations.
